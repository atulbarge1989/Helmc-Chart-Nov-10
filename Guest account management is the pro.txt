Guest account management is the process of administering and managing user accounts and access for external guests. Guest accounts typically provide a set of default permissions and privileges for non-registered users of a system or service. Here are some aspects of guest account management: 
 
Adding guest users
Guest users can be password authenticated to allow limited access to an organization. 
 
Managing external users
Some applications, like YouTrack Server, allow users to enable access for anonymous users through a guest account. 
 
Delegating guest user management
Some applications, like Microsoft 365, allow application owners to add guest users directly to applications they want to share. 
 
Managing guest user lifecycle
Identity Governance can be used to manage the lifecycle of guest accounts. 
 
Cleaning up guest accounts
Azure Automation and scripting logic can be used to clean up guest accounts. 


The Guest Account Management Solution offers lifecycle management of third-party organizations and delegated administration for those organizations' users.
